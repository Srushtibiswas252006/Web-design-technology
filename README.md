<h2>GCOEN</h2>

<p><div>This Institute, commonly referred as GCOEN, was started functioning in 2016 with 5 UG & 1 PG Engineering Programmes under the administrative control of Higher and Technical Education, Govt. of Maharashtra. The Institute is affiliated to RTM Nagpur University Nagpur. Within a short span of time, GCOEN has established its own identity not only in the Vidarbha

region but also in the Maharashtra State. The students of high caliber are the backbones of the Institute.</div></p>

<p>It offers the following branches</p>

<p><div>1.Computer Science Engineering<br>

2.Electronics and Telecommunication<br>

3. Electrical Engineering<br>

4. Mechanical Engineering<br>

5.Civil Engineering</div>

<div class="items">Computer science and engineering (CSE) or Computer Science (CS) also integrated as Electrical engineering and Computer Science (EECS) in some universities, is an academic program at many universities which comprises approaches of computer science and computer engineering. There is no clear division in computing between science and engineering, just like in the field of materials science and engineering. However, some classes are historically more related to computer science (e.g. data structures and algorithms), and other to computer engineering (e.g. computer architecture). CSE is also a term often used in Europe to translate the name of technical or engineering informatics academic programs. It is offered in both undergraduate as well postgraduate with specializations.</div>

<div class="items">Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE) course comes under the Engineering field that includes the study, design, development, and application of electrical circuits, electronics, and communication systems. ECE courses are available at various levels such as Diploma, UG, and PG, which are offered by more than 4000 colleges in India. Universities are adding new subjects to their curriculum, such as the IoT, so they can better prepare the students for the future.

This allows students to learn how to design and develop interconnected devices that further act as the backbone of smart homes, cities, and industries. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are also finding their way into these courses, with applications in areas like optimizing communication networks and revolutionizing signal processing techniques.

<div class="items">Electrical engineering is the study of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. Electrical engineers design, build, test, analyze, and document a wide range of devices, machines, systems, and sub-systems.
